Presentation Notes


	- Combined Historic

		- Since the beginning of the year, most natural disasters seen in the US up until late march (first major signs of infections)
		  fall into the categories of floods or severe storms, with a tornado also appearing in Tennessee

		- at the beginning of april, a myriad of storms causing havoc in the SE united states coincided with NY's major outbreak
			- Tennessee was experiencing one of the worst total infections / populations at the time and was hit by storms
		- the region hit by these storms seemed to be doing poorly with infections by the end of the month
		- when looking at the article [], we can see that this storm drastically affected the region and may have contributed
			to the relative spread in the region 
			- "In Alabama, people seeking shelter from tornadoes huddled in community shelters, protective masks covering their faces to guard against the new coronavirus."
			- Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said the storms were “as bad or worse than anything we’ve seen in a decade.”
			- Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said some storm victims already were out of work because of shutdowns caused by COVID-19. "Now they have lost literally everything they own,”

		- Even if the virus does not displace enough people or cause enough people to stop sheltering
			- the financial burdens placed on a state and emergency response capacity is lowered

		- Using projected data from brooks and Alicia, I wanted to see which regions of the US were potential 'risk zones' moving forward

		- Due to the unpredictability or infrequency of certain natural disasters (Earthquake, volcano)
			only Hurricanes, Floods, and Fires were projected



		- HURRICANES
			- Gulf storms are more prevalent in the beginning of the hurricane season, making states such as TX, LA, MS, AL, and FL more susceptible in the near future
				- june / july
			- major uptick in hurricanes in August - slamming entire coast
				- this forecasts to be a major problem for NC, and any other state who sees increases late in summer


		- Flooding
			- In May and Early june, the areas most at risk for flooding are those in the central united states
				- the missouri basin / Arkansas-White River Basin / Red River basin run through some of the most
					- https://www.memphisweather.blog/2011/04/attention-turns-from-severe-weather-to.html
				- highly projected growing impact zones in the country
			- By mid june, the flooding has subsided, but still affects the general area
			- nothing major in August

		- Fire
			- The SW united states see rapidly increasing rates of fire between May-August and will need to be prepared
				- The west coast is doing comparatively well with other parts of the country, but fires are fast and furious 
				- AZ is the only state with noticeably elevated projections in the area
					- very high rate of infection in navajo tribes
