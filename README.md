# Coalescence of COVID-19 with Natural Disasters
***Brooks Jessup - Alicia Rodriguez - Griffin Talan***

## Problem Statement
In order to solve a client problem, we are tasked with determining the overlap with between COVID-19 infection rates and the occurence of natural disasters so that the overall impact of both disasters does not combine to create a larger problem. 

The COVID component of this project aims to identify areas at risk for COVID-19, so that these can be compared and overlaid with areas at risk for other natural disasters. It focuses on two geographical scales: the state level on a national scale, and the county level within the state of California. The temporal scope of the state-level analysis runs from mid-May to early August, and the county-level analysis runs from mid-May to mid-June. The specific questions answered by the COVID component of our project are as follows: (1) Which states in the U.S. are most likely to experience severe COVID-19 conditions between mid-May and early August? (2) Which counties in California are most likely to experience severe COVID-19 conditions between mid-May and mid-June? (Also see the  README file in the COVID section of the repository.)

The Natural Disaster directories aim to explore the frequency of natural disasters in which there is a need for evacuation per US states and California's counties. 
By combining the future predictions of each data source and mapping with GIS, and overlay of at-risk areas was determined.


## Data Collection

### COVID

To identify communities at risk for severe COVID conditions in the coming months, we collected projected data from leading research centers in the field of public health. We evaluated and selected projected data based on the criteria of expertise, transparency, and thoughtfulness of the models, as well as the relevancy of the information they provide for answering our specific questions. For our data on the national scale, we selected the projections generated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. For our data on the county-level in California, we selected the projections generated by the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University. (See COVID Readme file)

**Data Dictionary**

| Feature  | Description  |
|---|---|
|est_new_infections    |Estimated number of daily new infections   |
|est_population  |Estimated population size from 2019 based on the 2010 census   |
|daily_infection_rate  |Estimated number of daily new infections per 10,000 people in the local population   |
|severe   |1 if the daily infection rate is 1 or above; 0 if below 1   |

### Natural Disasters

The source for natural disaster data collection was FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency. This dataset is a declaration of the disasters summary from 1953 - 2020, for this project we took into account the data from 2010 - 2020 and obtain the frequency by dividing the total events by 10. Originally the data showed 26 disasters in the nation, but only 6 were taken into consideration which are the ones were evacuation of the population is needed which in this time of COVID-19 will be a high risk for its spread. The 6 natural disasters are the following:

- Hurricanes
- Floods
- Fires
- Earthquakes
- Tsunamis
- Volcanoes

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### COVID-19

For both the IHME and MSPH projected data, we reduced the shape of the data to our desired geographic scales (i.e. the United States and California, respectively). In both datasets, we decided to focus only on the estimated number of daily new infections, and to scale this figure in proportion to the size of the local population. Following Californiaâ€™s guidelines for the reopening of counties, we labeled communities (state or county) with one or more new daily infections per 10,000 residents as experiencing severe COVID conditions. (See COVID Readme file.)

### Natural Disasters

We wil analyze different aspects like states, counties, incident types and months to have a visualization of these features in relation with natural disasters. The top three states and CA counties that have a higher frequency per year of the 6 natural disasters mentioned above are:

***National***

| State  |Frequency per Year (Natural disasters) Nationwide  |
|---|---|
|California | 8.6  |
|Texas   |5.1   |
|Washington   |4.4   |

***California***

|County  |Frequency per Year (Natural disasters) CA  |
|---|---|
|Los Angeles | 2  |
|Kern   |1.3   |
|Riverside   |1.2   |


Also is very important to highlight which are the highest risky months for these natural disasters to occur along the year.
We can observe that nationwide is making reference for the upcoming months of the year that we should take into consideration. One way that FEMA supports these disasters is through mission assignments which are resources for emergency management needs; this information can support FEMA as a reference on where and when to allocate their resources.

***National***

|Month   |Natural Disasters Frequency Nationwide (yearly)  |
|---|---|
|August   |13  |
|June   |8.8   |
|July   |8   |

***California***

|Month   |Natural disasters frequency per  CA Counties (yealy)   |
|---|---|
|February   |4.4  |
|October   |3.4   |
|August   |3.2   |


Following these tables, because we are analyzing the convergence between natural disasters and COVID-19; let's observe the following months from May to August (4 month range) regarding to which states and CA counties are most likely to be impacted by natural disasters. We can notice that the main 3 counties are located in South California.

***National***

| State  |Natural Disasters frequency in the range from May - August Nationwide |
|---|---|
|California |4.8  |
|Washington   |3.3  |
|Texas   |2.5  |

***California***

| County  |Natural Disasters frequency in the range from May - August CA |
|---|---|
|Shasta |0.7  |
|Kern   |0.7  |
|Los Angeles   |0.6  |


In this time range (May-August) the natural disasters that we have to be aware as a nation and as the state of California are:

***National***

|Incident Type   |Natural Disaster Frequency Nationwide  |
|---|---|
|Fire   |24.1   |
|Floods   |5.8   |
|Hurricane   | 4  |
|Earthquake   | 0.4  |
|Volcanoes  |0.1   |

***California***

|Incident Type   |Natural Disaster Frequency CA counties  |
|---|---|
|Fire   | 6.7  |
|Earthquake   |0.4   |

## Data Combination and Mapping/Visualization

Using folium for GIS, overlay maps illustrating the relationship between the frequency of natural disaster occurences per state and the square root of the incidence of covid infection per population. The target rate for covid was right-skewed, and this transformation allowed for more distinct separations between states were plotted. The radius of marker points relating to natural disasters represents their relative frequency against disasters of the same type. Latitudes and Longitudes for each state were appended to the data and all dates were converted to datetime format. 

## Conclusions

Our analysis of the projections for the spread of COVID-19 shows that, even though the prevalence of the disease was already declining in many communities due to social distancing, a significant number of communities remain at risk for severe COVID conditions over the next few months. (See the COVID Readm file.)

The natural disaster data information will be very useful in determining which months and types of disasters are likely to happen in each state and allocate resources where and when they are needed. As a nation, the months where we expect the highest frequency of natural disasters are June to August each year. California, Washington and Texas are the states from May through August that might be impacted with these natural diasters. Shasta, Kern and Los Angeles are the counties within Califronia where there is a higher propability of having these natural disasters from May through August. Fire and earthquakes are the natural disaster types that can affect the spread of COVID-19 in the state of California through May to August.

By combining data sets and visualizing, three areas of concern for natural disaster / COVID-19 overlap were identified. 

***May/June flooding in the Nation's Central Basins***
This area contains states that are at higher infection rates than many parts of the country over the next two months and show a regular pattern of flooding due to runoff from the Sierra Nevada mountains.

***June/July/August West Coast Fires***
The west coast has seen major fire outbreaks over the past ten years and, even though they are experiencing lower rates of infection, are at serious risk for compounding disasters. Arizona's Navajo Native American tribe and the elderly population found in Arizona are particularly at risk in this region.

June Fires             |  July Fires

***July/August Hurricane Season Approaching***
Though the infection rates are projected to decrease in the next few months across the United States, the displacement of individuals during hurricanes should not be ignored. With many states reopening, long-term considerations for natural disasters must be taken into account, and the eastern seaboard will likely experience a serious storm in August or later.
